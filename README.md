## Why is sorting important?
1. Some applications need sorted information as an input. For example, to find the number of occurrences of distinct elements in a list of items.
2. Algorithms often use sorting as a key subroutine. Such algorithms include Dijkstra's algorithm in which we extract the minimum element after applying heap sort.
